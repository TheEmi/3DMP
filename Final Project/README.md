FINAL PROJECT:<br>

Name: Tora Tora ride<br>
Description: An amusement park ride that rotates around 2 different axis at the same time to create an interesting sensation
<br>
I chose this project because of the interesting movement and because i had
the ambition to move the whole mechanism from a single gear from the moment i saw the video
<br>
HOW IT WORKS: The mechanism rotates the Base Wheel to move the whole Ride around
the global Z axis and uses the difference in movement from the Base Wheel and the Base to move a gear on the Base wheel.
This causes the whole ride to be related to the Base Wheel and maked it simple to rotate the Ride around it's own tilted Z axis.
<br>
TO OPERATE THE RIDE: You turn the Operator joint or play the Rotate motion study
